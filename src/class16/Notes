Inheritance:
     Inheritance allows us to build classes from existing classes.
     We can inherit fields and methods from existing classes if we need them in other classes.

     There are 5 major types of inheritance.
     1) Single inheritance.
     2) Hierarchical Inheritance.
     3) Multilevel Inheritance.
